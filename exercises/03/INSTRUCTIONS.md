# ABOUT THIS EXERCISE: CALCULATOR <br>

### UI
17 buttons: numbers from 0 to 9,  dot for floating values, equal sign to calculate total and Sum, Rest, Multiply and Division buttons.
Also, you will need a div that displays the total calculated based on the operation selected and a Clear Button to start over.

### Functionality
You will need to add a variable that starts at 0, this will store the total calculated.
When the user types the value, you will need a timeout to store the full number into a variable, this will be X value, same will happen with the second value after clicking the operation sign. This will be your Y value, and your operation will be X + Y,  X - Y, X * Y  or X / Y.  Your total will be calculated after the user clicks the Equals (=) sign and displayed on the pink field.
For each operation, you can use a different function, like sum(), rest(), multiply() and divide(). However, there's a more straightforward way to resolve this which is using the Math object in Javascript
